'''
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array.
The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,ยก-Y-1.
Example:Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
